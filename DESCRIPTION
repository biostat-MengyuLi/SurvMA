Description: Provide model averaging-based approaches that can be used to predict personalized survival probabilities. The key underlying idea is to approximate the conditional survival function using a weighted average of multiple candidate models. Two scenarios of candidate models are allowed: (Scenario 1) partial linear Cox model and (Scenario 2) time-varying coefficient Cox model. A reference of the underlying methods is Li and Wang (2023) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2023.107759>.
